Volcano_README.md

Volcano plots for publication were produced using the associated MATLAB code and Graphpad PRISM and the tsv files with the relevant signscore information. 
Most of the graphs were the same as the ones generated by the original code. 

The within clone (clone ID) volcano plot generated in the original code had fewer points than the plot generated using MATLAB and PRISM, but since the datapoints for the plot generated using MATLAB and PRISM contained all the WT-WT comparisons, we chose to use this plot for publication.
